Examples
--------

This project uses its own modules, and acts as its own example!

Additionally, the `tests/ <https://github.com/jgd-solutions/jgd-cmake-modules/tree/main/tests>`_ directory has sample projects that use *jgd-cmake-modules*.  Each project
acts as an example of using *jgd-cmake-modules* and the `Canonical Project Structure`_.
