## Examples

This project uses its own modules, and acts as its own example!

Additionally, the [tests/](https://github.com/jgd-solutions/jgd-cmake-modules/tree/main/tests) directory has sample
projects that use *jgd-cmake-modules*.
Each project acts as an example of using *jgd-cmake-modules* and
the [Canonical Project Structure](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p1204r0.html#:~:text=The%20canonical%20structure%20is%20primarily,specific%20and%20well%2Ddefined%20function.)
